Detailed Project Description
Agricolore is an app that shows people information that they want to know about agriculture, it shows a catalog that functions by pressing predefined buttons that when clicked send you to a list of themes of official NASA or NASA’s agency partners’ websites of the chosen theme that reveals the desired details.

This App filters information according to the user’s criteria depending on what they need or are looking for. The app's main objective is to let farmers solve the doubts that they have in the least time possible, it also helps them be aware of possible dangers that may be around and how they function.



The app would help farmers who don’t have clear information to know what to do or what they need to know, because in rural areas it is common to have short access to key data or crucial warnings that could help or save the crops of flora that they take care of.

The design helps browse through the app easily without needing to go to check  other websites that may not contain official information or are not accessible because of connection problems. It has written information that can be accessed without internet connection, but will still have the links to the official website where the information was taken from.



Our goal is to reach people all around the world and help them with their jobs by giving them information that can be a key part to the success of their growing season or just that they’d want to know.
